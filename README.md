# ETH-NFT
trying to create NFT on Solidity


1. Write the Solidity smart contract that defines the NFT and its properties, such as the name, symbol, and metadata.
2. Compile the Solidity code using a compiler like Remix or Truffle.
3. Deploy the smart contract to a blockchain network like Ethereum.
4. Create a web interface that interacts with the smart contract, allowing users to mint new NFTs and view existing ones.

This contract uses the OpenZeppelin library to define an ERC721-compliant NFT. The mintNFT() function allows anyone to mint a new NFT by specifying the recipient's address and the token's metadata URI.

Once you've written and compiled the Solidity code, you can deploy it to a blockchain network like Ethereum using a tool like Remix or Truffle. Then, you can create a web interface that interacts with the smart contract using a library like Web3.js. This interface can allow users to mint new NFTs, view existing ones, and transfer them to
